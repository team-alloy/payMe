##### Information

##### Set up
> Make sure client/src/services/config.js is made with all your API key and secret information is stored there or in the knexfile.js.
> You are also going to need the **four** Twilio programmable video API keys. Those can go in the config file as well. Make sure to place these into the **.env** file for deployment as well.
